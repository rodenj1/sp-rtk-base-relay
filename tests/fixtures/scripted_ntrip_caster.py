"""A scripted NTRIP caster for testing the Relay's NTRIP client input.

Listens on a real localhost socket and plays one Script per accepted
connection: send a reply once the client's request has arrived, then body
pieces, then hold the connection open or close it. Records each request.
(MockNtripCaster is the other role: a caster receiving a server's upload.)
